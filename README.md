# Feature

1. Interactive Map Display (Powered by OSM Tiles):<br>   
<br> 
<p>
This core feature involves rendering a world map using tiles provided by OpenStreetMap.<br>   The application will dynamically load and display these tiles as the user navigates, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience.   <br> The initial map view could be centered on a specific location, perhaps based on the user's geolocation or a default setting.  
</p>
<br>
<br>

2. Zoom and Pan Functionality (Intuitive Map Exploration): <br>  
<p>
Users will have full control over how they explore the map.<br>   Standard mouse interactions (clicking and dragging to pan, scrolling to zoom) will be supported. <br>  Zoom controls (buttons or a slider) could be included for users who prefer a more traditional interface.  
</p>
<br> 
<br> 

3. Customizable Map Layers (Visualizing Data on the Map): <br>
<p> 
This feature allows for the addition and customization of various layers on top of the base map.  These layers can represent different types of data or features.  Examples include:
  <p>- Markers: Icons or custom images placed on the map to represent specific points of interest (e.g., alrams, events). Clicking on a marker could display a pop-up with detailed information about that location.</p>
  <p>- Lines: Polylines drawn on the map to represent routes, boundaries, or connections between locations. These lines could be styled with different colors, widths, and opacities.</p>
  <p>- Data Integration (Connecting to External Data Sources):  The application will be capable of integrating data from external sources to enrich the map visualization.  Common data formats like GeoJSON will be supported.</p>

</p>
<br> 
<br> 

4. User Interactions (Clicking for Information, Tooltips, etc.):  <br>
<p> 
The application will provide interactive features that allow users to engage with the map.  This goes beyond simple zoom and pan.  Examples include:
  <p>- Click Events: Clicking on a map feature (marker, line, shape) will trigger an action, such as displaying a pop-up window with detailed information about the feature.</p>
  <p>-  Hover Effects: Hovering the mouse over a map feature could highlight the feature or display a tooltip with basic information.</p>
  <p>- Tooltips: Small pop-up boxes that appear when the user hovers over a map feature, providing a brief description or summary.</p>
